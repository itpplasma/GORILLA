	abstract = {We study symplectic numerical integration of mechanical systems with a Hamiltonian specified in non-canonical coordinates and its application to guiding-center motion of charged plasma particles in magnetic confinement devices. The technique combines time-stepping in canonical coordinates with quadrature in non-canonical coordinates and is applicable in systems where a global transformation to canonical coordinates is known explicitly but its inverse is not. A fully implicit class of symplectic Runge-Kutta schemes has recently been introduced and applied to guiding-center motion by Zhang et al. (2014) [9]. Here a generalization of this approach with emphasis on semi-implicit partitioned schemes is described together with methods to enhance performance, in particular avoiding evaluation of non-canonical variables at full time steps. For application in toroidal plasma confinement configurations with nested magnetic flux surfaces a global canonicalization of coordinates for the guiding-center Lagrangian by a spatial transform is presented that allows for pre-computation of the required map in a parallel algorithm in the case of time-independent magnetic field geometry. Guiding-center orbits are studied in stationary magnetic equilibrium fields of an axisymmetric tokamak and a realistic three-dimensional stellarator configuration. Superior long-term properties of symplectic methods are demonstrated in comparison to a conventional adaptive Runge-Kutta scheme. Finally statistics of fast fusion alpha particle losses over their slowing-down time are computed in the stellarator field on a representative sample, reaching a speed-up of the symplectic Euler scheme by more than a factor three compared to usual Runge-Kutta schemes while keeping the same statistical accuracy and linear scaling with the number of computing threads.},

Simulations including the separatrix and scrape-off layer are exercised for a model DIII-D H-mode plasma. Neutral particle recycling is modeled by means of ionization and charge exchange with the plasma. A fully nonlinear Fokker–Planck collision operator is utilized to account for non-Maxwellian edge plasma. The study yields kinetic evidence that (i) neglecting the non-axisymmetric component of the RMP-generated electrostatic potential perturbation could yield a fictitiously high particle pump-out rate in the edge pedestal; that (ii) the experimental level of particle pump-out from the pedestal cannot be provided by collisional transport across Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser surfaces except across the magnetic separatrix where stochastic magnetic field lines exist; that (iii) the H-mode type electron heat barrier is retained in the steep slope area under the M3D-C1 calculated RMPs; and that (iv) the stochastic electron heat-transport rate around the magnetic separatrix surface is much lower than the prediction by Rechester–Rosenbluth (1978 Phys. Rev. Lett. 40 38–41) and is qualitatively consistent with the experimentally observed rate. Detailed kinetic physics analysis on how the transport fluxes, electrostatic potential perturbation, and -well structure respond to onset of RMPs is also reported.},

The role of fluid resonances is studied, in particular the role of the resonance associated with the equilibrium electric field reversal point Er = 0.

Including the ion polarization current gives the time rate of change of the radial electric field and related evolution of the rotation velocity components. A special orbit initialization for a quiescent start and an efficient radial flux solving algorithm with reduced numerical noise are developed. Numerical stability of the method with respect to the strength of the perpendicular viscosity and Mach number of the poloidal rotation is investigated. This new approach enables one to separate the nonambipolar transport characteristics from the ambipolar ones. Because nonambipolar transport can support sheared flows, this model can provide a very efficient tool for studying transport barriers and related neoclassical mechanisms in toroidal plasmas.},

Plasmas 19, 072505 (2012)], a gyrokinetic neoclassical study is performed with gyrokinetic ions and drift-kinetic electrons. Besides the gyrokinetic improvement of ion physics from the drift-kinetic treatment, a fully non-linear Fokker-Planck collision operator—that conserves mass, momentum, and energy—is used instead of Koh et al.'s linearized collision operator in consideration of the possibility that the ion distribution function is non-Maxwellian in the steep pedestal. An inaccuracy in Koh et al.'s result is found in the steep edge pedestal that originated from a small error in the collisional momentum conservation. The present study concludes that (1) the bootstrap current in the steep edge pedestal is generally smaller than what has been predicted from the small banana-width (local) approximation [e.g., Sauter et al., Phys. Plasmas 6, 2834 (1999) and Belli et al., Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 50, 095010 (2008)], (2) the plasma flow evaluated from the local approximation can significantly deviate from the non-local results, and (3) the bootstrap current in the edge pedestal, where the passing particle region is small, can be dominantly carried by the trapped particles in a broad trapped boundary layer. A new analytic formula based on numerous gyrokinetic simulations using various magnetic equilibria and plasma profiles with self-consistent Grad-Shafranov solutions is constructed.},

In this case the magnetic ﬁeld cannot generally be described by ideal MHD equilibrium equations in the vicinity of resonant magnetic surfaces where parallel and perpendicular relaxation timescales are comparable. Usually, resistive MHD models are used to describe these regions. In the present work, a kinetic model is used for this purpose. Within this model, plasma response, current and charge density are computed with help of a Monte Carlo method, where guiding center orbit equations are solved using a semianalytical geometrical integrator. Besides its higher eﬃciency in comparison to usual integrators this method is not sensitive to noise in ﬁeld quantities. The computed charges and currents are used to calculate the electromagnetic ﬁeld with help of a ﬁnite element solver. A preconditioned iterative scheme is applied to search for a self-consistent solution. The discussed method is aimed at the nonlinear kinetic description of RMPs in experiments on Edge Localized Mode (ELM) mitigation by external perturbation coil systems without simpliﬁcation of the device geometry.},

This method has been treated by various writers, and solutions are available for telegraph lines with simple terminal conditions. It is well known that the extension of the same methods to more complicated terminal conditions, which represent the usual terminal apparatus, leads to great difficulties. The present paper attacks the same problem from the alternative standpoint of the steady-state characteristics of the system. This method has the advantage over the method of transients that the complication of the circuit which results from the use of terminal apparatus does not complicate the calculations materially. This method of treatment necessitates expressing the criteria of distortionless transmission in terms of the steady-state characteristics. Accordingly, a considerable portion of the paper describes and illustrates a method for making this translation. A discussion is given of the minimum frequency range required for transmission at a given speed of signaling. In the case of carrier telegraphy, this discussion includes a comparison of single-sideband and double-sideband transmission. A number of incidental topics is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Symplectic integrators offer many benefits for numerically approximating solutions to Hamiltonian differential equations, including bounded energy error and the preservation of invariant sets. Two important Hamiltonian systems encountered in plasma physics—the flow of magnetic field lines and the guiding center motion of magnetized charged particles—resist symplectic integration by conventional means because the dynamics are most naturally formulated in non-canonical coordinates. New algorithms were recently developed using the variational integration formalism; however, those integrators were found to admit parasitic mode instabilities due to their multistep character. This work eliminates the multistep character, and therefore the parasitic mode instabilities via an adaptation of the variational integration formalism that we deem “degenerate variational integration.” Both the magnetic field line and guiding center Lagrangians are degenerate in the sense that the resultant Euler-Lagrange equations are systems of first-order ordinary differential equations. We show that retaining the same degree of degeneracy when constructing discrete Lagrangians yields one-step variational integrators preserving a non-canonical symplectic structure. Numerical examples demonstrate the benefits of the new algorithms, including superior stability relative to the existing variational integrators for these systems and superior qualitative behavior relative to non-conservative algorithms.},

The main goal of code development was to provide a tool to investigate neutral gas transport in magnetically confined plasmas. But, due to its flexibility, it also can be used to solve more general linear kinetic transport equations by applying a stochastic rather than a numerical or analytical method of solution. Major applications of EIRENE are in connection with plasma fluid codes, in particular with the various versions of the B2 two-dimensional plasma edge fluid code. The combined code package B2-EIRENE was developed, again initially for TEXTOR applications, in the late 1980s. It too has become a standard tool in plasma edge science. It is currently mainly used for divertor configurations, such as by the ITER central team, to assist the design of the ITER divertor.

This interpolation method exactly preserves the order of the RK4 integrating scheme which is crucial for the investigation of fast particle trajectories in 3D magnetic structures such as helical saturated tokamak plasma states, stellarator geometry and resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP). The initialisation of particles with respect to the guiding-centre is discussed. Two approaches to implement RMPs in orbit simulations are presented, one where the vacuum field is added to the 2D equilibrium, creating islands and stochastic regions, the other considering 3D nested flux-surfaces equilibrium including the RMPs.},

It uses a Particle-In-Cell (PIC), $\delta$f scheme, 3D cubic B-splines finite elements for the field solver and several numerical noise reduction techniques. A particular feature is the use of straight-field-line magnetic coordinates and a field-aligned Fourier filtering technique that dramatically improves the performance of the code in terms of both the numerical noise reduction and the maximum time step allowed. Another feature is the capability to treat arbitrary axisymmetric ideal MHD equilibrium configurations. The code is heavily parallelized, with scalability demonstrated up to 4096 processors and 109 marker particles. Various numerical convergence tests are performed. The code is validated against an analytical theory of zonal flow residual, geodesic acoustic oscillations and damping, and against other codes for a selection of linear and nonlinear tests.},

The electromagnetic field is spatially discretized using the method of discrete exterior calculus with high-order interpolating differential forms for a cubic grid. The resulting time-domain Lagrangian assumes a non-canonical symplectic structure. It is also gauge invariant and conserves charge. The system is then solved using a structure-preserving splitting method discovered by He et al. [preprint arXiv:1505.06076 (2015)], which produces five exactly soluble sub-systems, and high-order structure-preserving algorithms follow by combinations. The explicit, high-order, and conservative nature of the algorithms is especially suitable for long-term simulations of particle-field systems with extremely large number of degrees of freedom on massively parallel supercomputers. The algorithms have been tested and verified by the two physics problems, i.e., the nonlinear Landau damping and the electron Bernstein wave.},

We found that the slow manifolds of the classical Pauli particle enable a family of structure-preserving geometric algorithms for guiding center dynamics with long-term stability and accuracy. This discovery overcomes the difficulty associated with the unstable parasitic modes for variational symplectic integrators when applied to the degenerate guiding center Lagrangian. It is a pleasant surprise that Pauli's Hamiltonian for electrons, which predated the Dirac equation and marks the beginning of particle physics, reappears in classical physics as an effective algorithm for solving an important plasma physics problem. This technique is applicable to other degenerate Lagrangians reduced from regular Lagrangians.},

The main feature of KNOSOS is that it relies on orbit-averaging to solve the drift-kinetic equation very fast. KNOSOS treats rigorously the effect of the component of the magnetic drift that is tangent to magnetic surfaces, and of the component of the electrostatic potential that varies on the flux surface, φ1. Furthermore, the equation solved is linear in φ1, which permits an efficient solution of the quasineutrality equation. As long as the radially local approach is valid, KNOSOS can be applied to the calculation of neoclassical transport in stellarators (helias, heliotrons, heliacs, etc.) and tokamaks with broken axisymmetry. In this paper, we show several calculations for the stellarators W7-X, LHD, NCSX and TJ-II that provide benchmark with standard local codes and demonstrate the advantages of this approach.},

In order to obtain a fully discrete Poisson integrator, the semi-discrete bracket is used in conjunction with Hamiltonian splitting methods for integration in time. Techniques from ﬁnite element exterior calculus ensure conservation of the divergence of the magnetic ﬁeld and Gauss’ law as well as stability of the ﬁeld solver. The resulting methods are gauge invariant, feature exact charge conservation and show excellent long-time energy and momentum behaviour. Due to the generality of our framework, these conservation properties are guaranteed independently of a particular choice of the ﬁnite element basis, as long as the corresponding ﬁnite element spaces satisfy certain compatibility conditions.},

Here, high order interpolation of electromagnetic fields in space is replaced by a special linear interpolation, leading to locally linear Hamiltonian equations of motion with piecewise constant coefficients. This approach reduces computational effort and noise sensitivity, while the conservation of total energy, magnetic moment and phase space volume is retained. The underlying formulation treats motion in piecewise linear fields exactly and, thus, preserves the non-canonical symplectic form. The algorithm itself is only quasi-geometric due to a series expansion in the orbit parameter. For practical purposes, an expansion to the fourth order retains geometric properties down to computer accuracy in typical examples. When applied to collisionless guiding-center orbits in an axisymmetric tokamak and a realistic three-dimensional stellarator configuration, the method demonstrates stable long-term orbit dynamics conserving invariants. In Monte Carlo evaluation of transport coefficients, the computational efficiency of quasi-geometric integration is an order of magnitude higher than with a standard fourth order Runge–Kutta integrator.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a calculation of neoclassical toroidal viscous torque independent of large-aspect-ratio expansions across kinetic regimes. The Perturbed Equilibrium Nonambipolar Transport (PENT) code was developed for this purpose, and is compared to previous combined regime models as well as regime specific limits and a drift kinetic δf guiding center code. It is shown that retaining general expressions, without circular large-aspect-ratio or other orbit approximations, can be important at experimentally relevant aspect ratio and shaping. The superbanana plateau, a kinetic resonance effect recently recognized for its relevance to ITER, is recovered by the PENT calculations and shown to require highly accurate treatment of geometric effects.},

	abstract = {The plasma energy Wp = ∫ωp(12B2 +pdV is minimized over a toroidal domain ωp using an inverse representation for the cylindrical coordinates R = ΣRmn(S) cos(mθ − nζ) and Z = ΣZmn(s) sin(mθ − nζ), where (s, θ, ζ) are radial, poloidal and toroidal flux coordinates, respectively. The radial resolution of the MHD equations is significantly improved by separating R and Z into contributions from even and odd poloidal harmonics which are individually analytic near the magnetic axis. A free boundary equilibrium results when ωp is varied to make the total pressure 12B2 + p continuous at the plasma surface Σp and when the vacuum magnetic field Bv satisfies the Neumann condition Bv·dΣp = 0. The vacuum field is decomposed as Bv = B0 + ∇φ, where B0 is the field arising from plasma currents and external coils and φ is an single-valued potential necessary to satisfy BvdΣp = 0 when p ≠ 0. A Green's function method is used to obtain an integral equation over Σp for the scalar magnetic potential φ = Σφmn sin(mθ − nζ). A linear matrix equation is solved for φmn to determine 12B2v on the boundary. Real experimental conditions are simulated by keeping the external and net plasma currents constant during the iteration. Applications to l = 2 stellarator equilibria are presented.},

	abstract = {We report on an accurate and efficient algorithm for obtaining all roots of general real cubic and quartic polynomials. Both the cubic and quartic solvers give highly accurate roots and place no restrictions on the magnitude of the polynomial coefficients. The key to the algorithm is a proper rescaling of both polynomials. This puts upper bounds on the magnitude of the roots and is very useful in stabilizing the root finding process. The cubic solver is based on dividing the cubic polynomial into six classes. By analyzing the root surface for each class, a fast convergent Newton-Raphson starting point for a real root is obtained at a cost no higher than three additions and four multiplications. The quartic solver uses the cubic solver in getting information about stationary points and, when the quartic has real roots, stable Newton-Raphson iterations give one of the extreme real roots. The remaining roots follow by composite deflation to a cubic. If the quartic has only complex roots, the present article shows that a stable Newton-Raphson iteration on a derived symmetric sixth degree polynomial can be formulated for the real parts of the complex roots. The imaginary parts follow by solving suitable quadratics.},
