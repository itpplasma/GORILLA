GORILLA computes guiding-center orbits for charged particles of given mass, charge and energy in toroidal fusion devices with three-dimensional field geometry. This guiding-center orbit code is designed to be used in scientific plasma physics simulations in the field of magnetic confinement fusion.

### Summary
The guiding-center orbits are traced via a quasi-geometric integration method described in Ref. [1].
There, high order interpolation of electromagnetic fields in space is replaced by a special linear interpolation, leading to locally linear Hamiltonian equations of motion with piecewise constant coefficients. The underlying formulation treats the motion in the piecewise linear fields exactly. This further leads to conservation of total energy, magnetic moment and phase space volume. Furthermore, the approach reduces computational effort and noise sensitivity.
Guiding-center orbits are computed without taking collisions into account.

For various simulations in magnetic confinement fusion, direct modeling of guiding-center particle orbits is utilized, e.g. global kinetic computations of quasi-steady plasma parameters or fast alpha particle loss estimation for stellarator optimization. In such complex simulations a simple interface for the guiding-center orbit integration part is needed. Namely, the initial condition in five-dimensional phase space is provided (e.g. guiding-center position, parallel and perpendicular velocity) and the main interest is in the condition after a prescribed time step while the integration process itself is irrelevant. Such a pure “orbit time step routine” acting as an interface with a plasma physics simulation is provided (`orbit_timestep_gorilla`).
However, the integration process itself can be of high interest as well, thus, a program allowing the detailed analysis of guiding-center orbits, the time evolution of their respective invariants of motion and Poincaré plots is at disposal as well (`gorilla_plot`).
Both applications are realized for demonstration in the program (`test_gorilla_main`).

### License
The code is free to use and modify under the MIT License and links to Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg routines in
`SRC/contrib/rkf45.f90` from https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/rkf45/rkf45.html under the GNU LGPL License.

### Magnetic field input
The magnetic field can be provided by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equilibria with nested magnetic flux surfaces either in 2D (e.g. EFIT) or in 3D (e.g. VMEC). Supported equilibria are in the g-file or NetCDF format, respectively.
For both equilibria formats, test files for the limited purpose of computing guiding-center orbits are provided.
The g-file test equilibrium (`g_file_for_test`) was provided by the ASDEX Upgrade Team for testing purposes and corresponds to the axisymmetric tokamak field configuration of ASDEX Upgrade (shot 26884 at 4300 ms) described in Ref. [3].
The VMEC NetCDF test equlibrium (`netcdf_file_for_test.nc`) was provided by Michael Drevlak for testing purposes and corresponds to the stellarator field configuration described in Ref. [4], namely, a quasi-isodynamic reactor-scale device with five toroidal field periods and a major radius of 25 m.

## Documentation
A detailed description of the working principle of GORILLA can be found in `DOCUMENTATION/GORILLA_DOC.pdf`.
The following supplemental material is available in `DOCUMENTATION/SUPPLEMENTAL_MATERIAL`:
* arXiv preprint of Ref. [1]
* Master's thesis of M. Eder (preliminary work with some detailed explanations referenced in `GORILLA_DOC.pdf`)
* Master's thesis of L. Bauer (preliminary work with some detailed explanations referenced in `GORILLA_DOC.pdf`)

## Building

GORILLA can be built with `make`.

Required libraries:
* NetCDF
* LAPACK/BLAS

Supported compilers:
* GNU Fortan
* Intel Fortran

Include external library:
N. Flocke, “Algorithm 954: An Accurate and Efficient Cubic and Quartic Equation Solver for Physical Applications”
<https://doi.org/10.1145/2699468>

* Download supplemental material `954.zip` from above webpage.
```
wget -O 954.zip "https://dl.acm.org/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1145%2F2699468&file=954.zip&download=true"
```
* Copy `954/F90/Src/Polynomial234RootSolvers.f90` to `GORILLA/SRC/contrib/` and overwrite existing file.
  (Existing file with identical name is a placeholder which is necessary for compilation.)
```
unzip 954.zip
cp 954/F90/Src/Polynomial234RootSolvers.f90 SRC/contrib/
```
* GORILLA can be run without this external library. The computation of guiding-center orbits is then limited to the numerical Runge-Kutta option of GORILLA.


Building:
```bash
cd /path/to/GORILLA
make
```
This will produce `test_gorilla_main.x` required to run the code. To specify the location of
NetCDF includes and libraries, one has to set the `NCINC` and `NCLIB` variable during `make`.

## Usage

GORILLA currently runs on a single node with OpenMP shared memory parallelization with one particle per thread and background fields residing in main memory.

The main executable is `test_gorilla_main.x`.
As an input it takes ....

... the following input files which can be found in the folder `INPUT/`
* `tetra_grid.inp`                       (Input file for settings of the tetrahedronal grid used in GORLLA)
* `gorilla.inp`                             (Input file for settings of GORILLA)
* `gorilla_plot.inp`                   (Input file for the program for the analysis of guiding-center orbits)
* `field_divB0.inp`                     (Input file for loading g-file equilibria - Do not change this file.)
* `preload_for_SYNCH.inp`         (Input file for splining magnetic field data of g-file equilibria - Do not change this file.)

... and the MHD equilibrium files which can be found in the folder `MHD_EQUILIBRIA/`
* `netcdf_file_for_test.nc`: VMEC NetCDF equlibrium (File name can be specified in `tetra_grid.inp`.)
* `g_file_for_test`: g-file equilibrium (File name can be specified in `tetra_grid.inp`.)

## Examples

Expamles are realized in MATLAB and Python. For plotting with MATLAB, see below.
Five examples for plotting Poincaré cuts, full guiding-center orbits and the appropriate time evolution of invariants of motion can be found in `EXAMPLES/example_1` - `EXAMPLES/example_5`. There, the necessary soft links are already created and the input files are given, and runs are started with
```
./test_gorilla_main.x
```
To avoid hyperthreading issues, it is beneficial to limit the number of threads to
the number of actual CPU cores via the environment variable `$OMP_NUM_THREADS`.
Detailed descriptions of the respective input files can be found in `INPUT`.
After appropriate compilation of GORILLA, the code can be executed in all of these 5 example folders, respectively.
For the visualization of the output of these five examples, appropriate plotting methods are at disposal at. `PYTHON/plot_example_1.py` - `PYTHON/plot_example_5.py`.
