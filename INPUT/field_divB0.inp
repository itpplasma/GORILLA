More detailed comments on switches.
Axisymmetric equilibrium is called in all cases. If some routines are not 
called, their data is not required.

Perturbation switch "ipert": 
0 - axisymmetric equilibrium is called alone (can be run withot coild data
    and resonance plasma response data)
1 - cylindrical routine is called in addition to equilibrium (plasma response
    data is not required
2 - both, cylindrical and flux coordinate routine modelling plasma response
    are called, all data is required. Derivatives are not computed
3 - the same as 2 with computation of derivatives (7 times slower)

Equilibrium switch "iequil":
0 - equilibrium field is not added to the output (needed for computing the 
    perturbation field alone). The equilibrium routine is called - its
    data is needed for plasma response field. For future: this call can be
    disabled for stellarator modelling.
1 - normal mode, perturbation is added to the output field
